<h2>How a review is performed</h2>

<p>
Each review follows a defined, document-based process designed to provide
clear, repeatable outcomes while maintaining strict boundaries on scope
and interpretation.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Scope definition</strong>
    Before any documents are reviewed, the scope of the engagement is
    established. This includes the checklist applied, the document
    categories covered, and any explicit inclusions or exclusions. The
    scope is fixed prior to review and is not adjusted based on document
    content or findings.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Document submission</strong>
    Documents are submitted through a controlled channel and logged upon
    receipt. Each submission is assigned a reference identifier and review
    date for traceability. Only documents provided within the defined
    scope are considered as part of the review.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Document review</strong>
    Documents are reviewed on a document-only basis. The review is limited
    to confirming document presence, noting visible internal consistency,
    and recording stated validity or expiry information where available.
    No verification of authenticity, accuracy, safety, or regulatory
    compliance is performed.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Summary issuance</strong>
    Upon completion of the review, a Safety Readiness Summary (PDF) is
    prepared. The summary records the documents reviewed, identifies
    missing, expired, or unclear items, and documents observations strictly
    within the defined scope. All limitations and disclaimers are
    explicitly stated in the summary.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Retention and deletion</strong>
    Submitted documents are retained only for the period required to
    complete the review. After completion, all documents are deleted in
    accordance with the stated retention window. Review logs containing
    reference identifiers and processing metadata are preserved.
  </li>
</ol>
