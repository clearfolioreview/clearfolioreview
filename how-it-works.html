    <h2>How a review is performed</h2>

    <p>
      Each review follows a defined, document-based process designed to
      provide structured and repeatable outcomes while maintaining clear
      boundaries on scope and interpretation.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Scope definition</strong>
        Before any documents are reviewed, the scope of the engagement is
        established. This includes the checklist applied, the document
        categories covered, and any explicit inclusions or exclusions.
        The scope is fixed prior to review and is not adjusted based on
        document content or findings.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Document submission</strong>
        Documents are submitted through a controlled channel and logged
        upon receipt. Each submission is assigned a reference identifier
        and review date for traceability. Only documents provided within
        the defined scope are considered as part of the review.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Document review</strong>
        Documents are reviewed on a document-only basis. The review is
        limited to confirming document presence, noting visible internal
        consistency, and recording stated validity or expiry information
        where available. No verification of authenticity, accuracy,
        safety, or regulatory compliance is performed.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Summary issuance</strong>
        Upon completion of the review, a Safety Readiness Summary (PDF) is
        prepared. The summary records the documents reviewed, identifies
        missing, expired, or unclear items, and documents observations
        strictly within the defined scope. All limitations and disclaimers
        are explicitly stated in the summary.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Retention and deletion</strong>
        Submitted documents are retained only for the period required to
        complete the review. After completion, all documents are deleted
        in accordance with the stated retention window. Review logs
        containing reference identifiers and processing metadata are
        preserved.
      </li>
    </ol>
